My website is an e-commerce project that specializes in video game sales. It offers a variety of options to its visitors.
Through PHP I've created multiple RESTapis designed to either provide SQL data or push new data to it.
React is responsible for the entire frontend and most of the functionality. All the data recived through React is passed to PHP (profile registration, profile update, purchases).
